<#You should write a function to convert a Fahrenheit temperate to Celsius 
and a second function to do the opposite. The functions can be very simple
with a single parameter for the value to convert. You donâ€™t need to worry
about passing values from the pipeline, error handling or anything advanced.
The function can simply write the converted value to the pipeline as a result.
If you are feeling a bit more confident, have your function write an object to
the pipeline with the original and converted values.
Even though this is a basic and beginner challenge,
you should still follow PowerShell scripting best practices such as
using a proper verb-noun naming convention. If you feel a bit more skilled,
feel free to include error handling, parameter validation and pipeline input.

        Write-Host -ForegroundColor Green "Yo what's up $Celcius"

    } elseif ($Fahrenheit -ne "") {
    
    Write-Host -ForegroundColor Yellow "Yo what's up $Fahrenheit"

    }

($f-32)/1.8
