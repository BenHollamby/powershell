You’re required to produce a function to move AD user accounts between OUs. The user should have their current 
group memberships removed and be added to the groups of the other users in the OU. Assume that all users in the 
OU will have the same group membership. 
Any user that hasn’t logged on for more than 90 days should be moved to a holding OU BUT should retain their 
group memberships. These accounts should be disabled.
Your solution will be judged on:
• Style
• Completeness
• Faction alignment 
• Adherence to Iron Scripter rules
