function Get-VMMDetails {

<#

.SYNOPSIS
Get System Center Virtual Machine Manager Host and VM information.

.DESCRIPTION
This command queries whether VMM host is currently active.
Then queries each Hyper-V host and will return issues only if ComputerState,
HyperVState, CommunicationState, or OverallState is not OK. It will list the
host and which state is not ok.
Then the command queries each Virtual machine. If the VM is powered off and 
the name of the VM does not start with OFF, it will list as the VM as being powered off
and will also list the host that it is on.
If the VM status is listed with one of the following, IncompleteVMConfig,
HostnotResponding, or UnderMigration it will list the VM, which host it is on and the 
status it current has. (Will need to update as more states are discovered, or a catch all
of some kind for anything that is not "running".
